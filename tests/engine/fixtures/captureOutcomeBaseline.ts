/**
 * Regenerates `outcomeBaseline.json` from the CURRENT engine.
 *
 *   npx tsx tests/engine/fixtures/captureOutcomeBaseline.ts
 *
 * The fixture is a REGRESSION LOCK, not a spec: it pins the exact logs of the
 * shared sweep (`tests/engine/helpers/sweepConfigs.ts`) so that a change which
 * is supposed to be scoped to one mechanic cannot silently move anything else.
 * `outcomeRule.test.ts` reads it to guard the ATTRITION THRESHOLD BOUNDARY —
 * fights decided before turn `ATTRITION_START_TURN` must be untouched by
 * attrition work.
 *
 * Regenerate ONLY for a deliberate, reviewed rule change (and say so in the
 * `note` below), never to make a red test go green. Prints a per-case diff
 * against the existing fixture so the blast radius is visible.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts` file, so vitest never collects it.
